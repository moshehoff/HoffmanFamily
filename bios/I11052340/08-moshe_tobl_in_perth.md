 426 William St was Moishe and Tobl's first address in Perth. It is the block on the northeast corner of William St. and Robinson Ave. (just around the corner from the Brisbane St. shule).             

The handwriting appears to be that of Julius Lewis Glick JP. He was born in Russia, lived a while in England and arrived (first) in Adelaide in 1898. He had a draper's business, _Adelaide Tailoring_ in Hay St. Glick was a prominent member of the Jewish community. His strongest language was Yiddish.
