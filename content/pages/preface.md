### Preface by [Peter Hoffman|I11052359]

As a child I had no greater interest in family history and genealogy than others of my age, however, I listened to my parents' conversations, and without effort learned - and apparently faithfully memorised - little by little, a mass of data. Both my parents were in touch with and/or visited a large number of relatives both in Australia and overseas, and quite a few used to drop in at all hours to while away their time. So I overheard quite a lot. My grandfather [Morrie Hoffman|I11052340] told us a few stories, but to my everlasting regret I never interrogated him with intent. In my teens I saw a genealogy of the Hoffman family which my father prepared for a relative in Melbourne, another Hymie Hoffman. A few years later I came across a brief outline of my grandmother Theresia's ancestors, which she had written in the 1950's. It so interested me that I copied it, and fortunately I kept my copy, because the original has been lost. It is clear that my interest to know more about my family was already kindled.

Later I saw and preserved genealogies prepared by my mother [Edith|I38516664], my aunt [Val Hoffman|I7293708], and more recently my father's cousin [Norm Hoffman|I6458664293], and my second cousin Philip Dzenciol, and others. Yet another genealogy was prepared in the 1970's when a relative developed Hodgkin's leukaemia, and a marrow donor had to be found.

In recent years I have made an effort to collect biographical material, however the sources whom I now know held the answers - our forebears - are long deceased. With regard to my grandparents, I woke up to this too late. It is a fact that whatever one doesn't commit to paper in his lifetime will be lost forever. In fact, a paper record has become more durable than a digital record which is subject to the whims of the managers of the site. For that reason I now make every effort to avoid that error, and record relevant material and trivia alike. It is through the trivia that a person's character will be appreciated.

With regard to my mother Edith's family, as a child I knew that she was born in Vienna, that her father came from Nikolsburg NB, and at some earlier time his ancestor came from Switzerland, and that the name Spielmann meant troubadour. About her mother I knew that she came from Neunkirchen. Furthermore I knew that her mother's family, Hönigsberg, was from Mattersdorf MD.

Over the years these sparse details became clearer to me. I found that most of my cousins knew no more.

At that time Nikolsburg and Mattersdorf were for me no more than names. In fact the connection with Mattersdorf was but a legend. My mother never visited there, though I understood that her mother did occasionally. My mother used to say that her cooking, which she had learnt from her own mother, was Hungarian. But that was no more than a hint, a taste of things which I would discover.

My knowledge of our origins has grown by degrees, by inquiry and by chance discovery of documents; by reason and by unexpected insights and correlations. Fortunately, the two Jewish communities – of Nikolsburg and of Mattersdorf– are among the best documented of the thousands destroyed by our persecutors. There are several developments which have immeasurably aided me in this ongoing work.

For one, the development of the Internet, which has enabled like-minded individuals to locate one another, share information, and meld into a community of researchers. Likewise it has been invaluable in locating and reestablishing contact with family members in various countries.
