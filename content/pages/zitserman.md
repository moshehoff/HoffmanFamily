# The Zitserman Family

**This paper includes updates as of October 2024.**

This uncommon Jewish family name was my grandmother's maiden name. I have not found its origin in any source, however I learned that in Yiddish a person who sits on a panel or in judgment is a besitser/בעזיצער from the word "zits"/זיץ "to sit". Thus a zitserman/זיצערמאן or as it is sometimes written – zaitserman - must have been a dayan/דיין - a member of a rabbinical court. In European languages constructions using the root words for seats, sitting (and even thronus) such as chairman, assizes, seat of government, a sitting, etc, are common.

## Bershad: The Zitserman Ancestral Home

**Bershad** (ברשד) was a small town in the Podolia Governate of the Russian Empire, located in what is now the Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. Like many shtetls in the Pale of Settlement, Bershad had a substantial Jewish community that formed the backbone of the town's commercial and cultural life.

![[bershad_synagogue.jpg]]

The Zitserman family was part of this community, with **[Aaron Zitserman|I38736034]** described on his daughters' death certificates as a business proprietor—a common occupation for Jews in the region, who were generally barred by law from owning agricultural land.

Jewish life in Bershad, as in other Podolian shtetls, revolved around the synagogue, religious education, and tight-knit family networks. The town was subject to the same antisemitic restrictions and periodic violence that afflicted Jewish communities throughout the Pale of Settlement, particularly during the pogroms of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
## Aaron Zitserman and Elka Vestil

**[Aaron Zitserman|I38736034]** of Bershad married **[Elka Vestil|I34711365018]**.

<div class="info-box">
A Digression into This Name

I have the name Vestil from the death certificates of two of his daughters (Tob'l and Pessy) where it is their mother's family name. The death certificate of Mariam notes that her mother was named Elka. This we know to be true. It follows that Vestil can only be the family name. Each of the three daughters – Tob'l, Pessy and Mariam - bore a daughter named Elke – they were Alyce Hoffman, Olga Schwarz and Elke Greenberg – in line with Jewish naming conventions. On his daughters' death certificates Aaron was described as a business proprietor.

Vestil: This rare Jewish family name appears to be unique to Russia and Moldavia. A search of the Jewish Genealogy databases and of the Shoah victims listed by Yad Vashem has not turned up much of relevance.

#### 6. [Yaakov (Yankele)|I34709512624] (~1880s–1913–1916)

Birth order not known. Leah Dzienciol said that he was a dayan in Bershad. Yaakov's great grandson Alex Igoudin "found" us in August 2017, and he has united our families and given us the following family details: Yankel Zitserman was probably born in the 1880s. He married Rachel (no last name survives). Yakov died sometime between 1913 and 1916. Yakov might have enlisted in the Russian army during WWI, in which Russia participated from 1914 to 1917, and perished then.

They had two children:
```
Yaakov (Yankele) & Rachel
│
├─ Maryam Zitserman (b. 1913)
└─ Aaron Zitserman
```

**[Maryam Zitserman|I34834840546]** (1913), who would have been only 1-2 years old when her father died.

**[Aaron Zitserman|I34834840576]**, birth year is not listed. He went to Argentina in the 1930s, returned to Ukraine, enlisted when the war broke out, and was killed at the front in 1941. He never married, and had no children.
## The Sydney Zitserman Family

We know of a Zitserman family, that left Russia and came to Sydney in 1980. My cousin Ruth (Uncle Wolf's daughter), by chance, met them. In August 1997 Philip Dzienciol visited and interviewed them with the intention of learning their family history. They are descended from **[Yoel (Yankele) Zitserman|I34835511484]** of Bershad, and **[Gittel|I34835511493].** Philip concluded that Yoel and our great grandfather [Aaron|I38736034] were brothers. **This has been subsequently confirmed by Lane.** **Philip also thought that Gittel and our great grandmother [Elke|I34711365018] were sisters.**

Yoel and Gittel had four sons and two daughters:
```
Yoel (Yankele) & Gittel
│
├─ Yitzchak
├─ Mordechai
├─ Shaike (~1883–~1932) m. Raizel Fabrikant
│   ├─ Luser (Eliezer) (b. 1921)
│   ├─ Mottl (b. 1910, killed in WWII)
│   ├─ Yoel (d. ~1987 in Kharkov)
│   ├─ Soybel 
│   ├─ Shaike (lived in Philadelphia, USA)
│   ├─ Ruchel (lived in Philadelphia, USA)
│   └─ Esther (d. ~1991)
├─ Moishe
├─ Batya
└─ Chaiya
```

**Shaike** b. ~1883, died ~1932, a furrier, married Raizel Fabrikant of Bershad. Shaike's son was Luser (Eliezer) b. 1921 in Bershad. He married Ruchel Rya who came with him to Sydney. Luser, the pater familias, was Philip's informant.

Luser married Rachel. Their son Mark (Marik) b. 1953 in Kharkov, married Ella. They live in Sydney. Their children are Allanah and Deborah (Debbie). 
```

**Allanah Zitserman** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allanah_Zitserman)) arrived in Australia in 1980 with her family, as a Russian refugee.
