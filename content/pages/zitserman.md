   This uncommon Jewish family name was my grandmother's maiden name.     I have not found its origin  in any source, however  I learned that in Yiddish

a person who sits on a panel or in  judgment  is a besitser בעזיצער   from the word  “zits”  זיץ  to sit.  Thus a zitserman   זיצערמאן   or as it is sometimes

written –  zaitserman -  must have  been a dayan   דיין  

 a member of a rabbinical court.  In European languages constructions using the root words for  seats, sitting (and even thronus) such as chairman, assizes,

seat of goverment, a sitting, etc, are common.  

   **Aaron Zitserman** of Bershad married  **Elka Vestil**.

    A digression into these names:

I have the name Vestil  from the death certificates of two of his daughters  (Tob’l and Pessy)  where it is their mother’s family name.

The death certificate of Mariam notes that her mother was named Elka.

This we know to be true. It follows that Vestil can only be the family name.

Each of the three daughters – Tob’l, Pessy and Mariam - bore  a  daughter

named Elke – they were Alyce Hoffman, Olga Schwarz and Elke Greenberg

– in line with Jewish naming conventions. On his daughters’  death certificates Aaron was described as a business proprietor.

   Vestil: This rare Jewish family name appears to be unique to Russia and Moldavia. A search of the Jewish Genealogy databases and of the Shoah victims listed by Yad Vashem has not turned up much of relevance. Vestil is a diminutive of vest, and as such refers to the fringed undershirt worn by  ארנע ארבעה כנפות  religious Jewish men: ie: arba kanfot.

  Their six children, were born in Bershad.

    1.  Arkadia.  She remained in Russia. She was married to a Zitserman (sic)  and had a daughter named Galya.

              We have no more details of this family.

    2.  Frida  ~1887 – 1955.  d.  in Odessa.

                Frida married  Mocha  Pesach of Olgopol.

               Olgopol was a town near Vinnitsa in the Podolia oblast.

               After about 1941 Olgopol became part of Transnistria, and was  no

              longer in the Ukraine or the USSR.

               They had six children of whom three (a.  c.  d.)  were war widows.

              a.  Charna.  Came out from Odessa as an old lady to Israel

                   and d. in Israel.

                   I know nothing of her. She had no issue.

                    She married (given name not known) Pesach.                                                                           

                     He was conscripted and fell in the world war.

               b.  Manya  May.  d.  in Odessa.  She married Boris Granovski.

                   He was a lieutenant, who fell at Stalingrad in 1942.

                   Nelli suffered from a hereditary neural dystrophy (Charcot Marie

                   Tooth) which affected her legs.

                   Nelli’s son Leonid b. ~1970 lives in Israel.

                    He has inherited the neural dystrophy from his mother.

                    He is single and has no issue.  I can’t tap him for more information

                    as he prefers not to respond.

              c.  Fanya  Feiga.  d. in Israel.    She married Pesach Zvesdina.

                   Came out from Odessa as an old lady to Israel and d. in Israel.

                   I know nothing of her. She had no issue.

              d.  Bronya  Bracha  b.  ~1918 in Olgopol.  d. Israel

                     Came out from Odessa as an old lady to Israel

                     and d. in Israel.

                     Bronya  m. Michael Solgan, b. in Olgopol. 

                     Michael was a captain (4 pips) in the  Red Army.

                     He fell in 1942  (before the battle of Stalingrad).

                     Their son Yefim (Fima) was born in 1938. He was a civil engineer

                     whose interest was in hydraulics.

                      He left Odessa and came to Israel. He had his own taxi and

                     supported himself until it was stolen.  After that he emigrated to                

                       Perth.  We were on very good terms. When I was in Perth                           

                     about ten years ago he was not at home. I don’t know the

                     situation  today.

                      Fima has a son, b. ~1970  in Russia, who remains there, he studied

                       turbines at the technical college in  St. Petersburg.

                e.  Arkadi  Aaron  Pesach b. ~1917. He was  a colonel (polkovnik)

                       in the Red Army who  fought  as far as Berlin. In later life he lived

**Letter from Myron Crain.  M & M Crain** <mandmcrain@yahoo.com>

Myron turned up on my sister’s DNA. This is his cordial letter to us from 2020.

Dear Sandi, Peter and David,

    Thanks so much for taking some time to write to me.  The Hoffmans were always some news from my mother Sara as we were growing up and throughout her life.  I have vague recollections of being with some of you when my family lived in Perth for six months in 1955.  I think that I attended some sort of religious school on occasion or other event.

    Anyway, my wife Margie and I live on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.  We retired here from San Diego 11 years ago.  We never had children by choice.  We will be married 50 years this September. My sister Jenny and her husband Shelly Silver live in Cape Cod, Massachusetts and have a 31 year old son, Sam who usually lives in Brooklyn, N.Y. with his long time partner Allison.  They are staying with Jenny and Shelly while the pandemic settles down (if ever).  Jenny lived in Perth only for about six months or so with my parents in 1973 and not since. My brother Paul is long divorced and lives in Carlsbad, California.  He never had children either.  Our family tree is much simpler than yours! All three of us are retired now.

    We usually travel a great deal for pleasure but are stationary at his point in time, as you might suspect.  Being stuck on Kauai isn’t so bad and we are enjoying it.   I went to UCLA and California State for my bachelors degree and then to USC for an MBA.  I spent my working years in Real Estate and construction always working for myself. We lived in Southern and Central California all of our working years.

    My only living relative on Sara’s side is Michael Kemeny, Alka’s (Alice’s) husband, who is 94 and living at Montgomery House care facility in Mont Claremont, Perth.  Paul, Jenny and myself have visited him many times over the years, most recently last year.

    Please forward this on as you please.

All the very best, Myron

   I was born Sept. 20, 1946.

     In 1927, my grandfather Morris  Hoffman nominated  Motchka Millman, Marian and their children for immigration  to Australia  (Australian National Archives).

 6   **Yaakov  (Yankele)**   birth order not known.   Leah Dzienciol  said that he

         was a dayan in Bershad.

           Yaakov’s great grandson Alex Igoudin “found” us in August 2017,

       and  he has united our families and given us the following family details:

           Yankel Zitserman was probably born in the 1880s.

       He married Rachel (no last name survives). Yakov died sometime between  
       1913 and 1916.  Yakov might have enlisted in the Russian army during   

       WWI, in which Russia participated from 1914 to 1917, and perished then.

       They had two children:

           **Maryam Zitserman** (1913)

        Maryam would have been only 1-2 years old when her father died.

          and  **Aaron Zitserman**, birth year is not listed. He went to Argentina in  
       the 1930s, returned to Ukraine, enlisted when the war broke out, and  
       was killed at the front in 1941. He never married, and  had no children.

    We know of a Zitserman family, that left Russia and came to Sydney

  in 1980.  Ruth Glasser Hoffman, by chance, met them.

  In August 1997  Philip Dzienciol  visited and interviewed them with the

  intention of learning their family history.

    They are descended from

         **Yoel (Yankele) Zitserman** of Bershad,  and **Gittel.**

   Philip concluded that Yoel and our great grandfather Aaron  were  brothers.

   **This has been subsequently confirmed by Lane****.**

      **Philip also thought that Gittel  and  our great grandmother Elke**

   **were sisters.**

        Yoel and Gittel had four sons and two daughters:

           Yitzchak

           Mordechai

           **Shaike**

           Moishe

           Batya

         and Chaiya.

     Shaike  b. ~ 1883,   d. ~ 1932.  a furrier,  married Raizel Fabrikant of Bershad.

    Shaike’s son was Luser (Eliezer)  b. 1921 in Bershad.  He married Ruchel Rya

     who  came with him to Sydney.

         Luser, the pater familias,  was Philip’s informant.

       Luser’s sibs were:

                   Mottl    b. 1910,    killed in the Second World War.                

                   Yoel   d. ~1987 in Kharkov.

                   Soybel  (a daughter).    dec.

                   Shaike,  a son    lived in Philadelphia, USA.

                   Ruchel,                lived in Philadelphia, USA.

               and Esther.     d. ~1991

         Luser married Rachel.

           Their son Mark (Marik) b. 1953 in Kharkov,  married Ella.

            They live in Sydney.

               Their children are Allanah and Deborah (Debbie)

            Their daughter Inna  b. 1958 in Kharkov,  an accountant,

              married Adolf (Eddy) Krimotat.

            They have has two children:

             Michael  b. 1981 in Sydney

           and  Jonathan  b. 1983 in Sydney.
