## The Names Opus

The study of names - onomastics, is fascinating. The origins and meanings of some of my family names eluded me for years. But one by one, and by various strokes of fortune, I arrived at the answers. Here I put them on record, both for their intrinsic interest, and to spare any other soul the effort I made to reach my conclusions. Names based on physiognomy and personal traits, Biblical figures, given names of relatives, occupations, places of origin, etc, are typical of those chosen by Jews. Throughout Europe, at various times civil administrations legislated that Jews adopt family names, whereas previously they had only given names and patronyms.

## Hochman Goichman Hoffman Hoffmann

Hochman simply is a tall man. Hoch הוך is Yiddish for high. The Yiddish spelling is הוכמאן. The family lived in Podolia, Poland which was annexed by Russia in 1793. The Russian administration, lacking the consonant "h" in speech and in script, substituted a Cyrillic "g" , hence the name was written and pronounced as Goichman.

When the family migrated to Australian and the USA, the locals were unable to pronounce the gutteral "ch" sound. About 1904, [Haym Yudl Hochman|I11032861] began to write his name as Hoffman, and 
subsequently, other newly arriving family members did the same, and changed their name to Hoffman. As an illustration of how arbitrary names were, at one time Hyam himself used the name “Hiram” in his dealings as fruit and wine seller retailer. 

There is one instance of the Hoffmann variant. My grandparents bought tickets to Australia on a German ship, the Scharnhorst, in Port Said in 1910. The shipping agent registered them as Hoffmann, a quite acceptable German name, and as such they landed at Fremantle.

## Alzofen

This was my great grandmother's maiden name in Poldolia. It is a rare name borne by Jews in several countries. Yiddish speaking Jews would pronounce the Hebrew given name El-tzafan (or Elitzafan) as Al-zo-fen, with the accent on the second syllable. Eltzafan אליצפן the son of Uzi'el of the tribe of Levi, was a cousin of Moses. See parashat Shmini, Leviticus.

## Sisselman

My grandfather's eldest brother [Shimon Me'ir|I11060285] took his second wife [Frida|I39965387] from this family. His son [Berl|I39965449] married Frida's sister [Rivka|I40775621]. Thus many of the Hoffman family are descended from the Sisselmans. The origin of the name is explained in the autobiography and genealogy of Rabbi Ya'akov Zvi Sisselman, their father. His ancestor, who lived near the city of Pinsk married a women called Zissel. Ziss, in Yiddish (as in German) means sweet. He became known as Zissel's man.
