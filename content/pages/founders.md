## The Founding Generation

### Savran: The Ancestral Home

Our family's story begins in **Savran** (סברן), a small town on the banks of the Lower Bug River in the Podolia Governate of the Russian Empire, in what is now the Odessa Oblast, Ukraine.

Until the late 18th century, Podolia formed part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and had a sizable Jewish population, numbering in the tens of thousands. In the Second Partition of Poland (1793), most of Podolia was incorporated into the Russian Empire. Under the new regime, Jews were largely confined to the former Polish territories that became known as the **Pale of Jewish Settlement**, and they were subjected to an extensive body of discriminatory legislation.

By the 1880s, Savran had a substantial Jewish community. Archival tax records from the early 1880s indicate roughly one thousand Jewish households in the town. In 1900, even after many families had emigrated, the Jewish population still numbered **3,198 persons**, making up a significant share of Savran’s inhabitants.

Many of the shtetls of Podolia were important centers of Hasidic Judaism, including Bratslav, Uman, Tulchin, and Mezhibozh. Jewish life revolved around the synagogue, the _heder_ (religious elementary school), and dense networks of mutual aid and family ties. Most Jews earned their livelihood as merchants, craftsmen, or small-scale traders, and were generally barred by law from owning agricultural land.

The majority Ukrainian population, influenced by centuries of church teachings, harbored deep antisemitism. As one family member later recalled: _“The Ukrainians imbibe their antisemitism with their mothers’ milk”_—a Yiddish saying he had learned from his parents.

### Wolf and Beile: The Founders

**[Wolf זאב Hochman|I11032885]** (circa 1840–circa 1890) was a timber merchant and cartwright in Savran. The surname **Hochman** is Yiddish for "tall man." Little else is known about Wolf's life, but he must have been a man of some means to support a large family in those difficult times.

Wolf's wife was **[Beile ביילא Hochman|I11032895]** (née Alzofen). The name **Beile** is derived from the Slavic word "biela," meaning "white." Outside Russia, her name was often recorded as "Bella".

Her maiden name, **Alzofen** (or Elizafan), is particularly rare and significant. It derives from **Elitzafan ben Uziel** (אליצפן בן עוזיאל), a Levite and cousin of Aaron and Moses who, according to the Torah (Exodus 6:22), took Aaron's sons Nadav and Avihu for burial. This distinguished biblical name appears in only a handful of Jewish families from the Russian Empire.

Wolf died between 1890 and 1892, when his youngest children were still small. We know this from Ashkenazi naming customs: sons are named after deceased ancestors, and in November 1892, a grandson received the name Wolf. His grave is presumed to be in Savran's Jewish cemetery, one of the few remnants of Jewish life that survived.

**Beile outlived her husband by more than two decades.** After seeing many of her children emigrate, she herself traveled to Ottoman Palestine around 1910. She passed away around 1914 or 1915 and was buried on the **Mount of Olives in Jerusalem** (הר הזיתים). We know this from family tradition and because a granddaughter born in Perth in 1915 was named Bella in her honor.

### The Children: A Generation Scattered

Wolf and Beile raised **ten children** in Savran during a time of increasing persecution and violence against Jews:

**1. [Shimon Meir מאיר Hochman|I11060285]** (b. circa 1865)
The eldest son. Shimon and his young family left Savran for Palestine around **1890**, fleeing pogroms with his infant son. He settled in Sarafand al-'Amar (later Tzrifin) and worked in Baron Rothschild's winery in Rishon LeZion. After his first wife [Bracha|I39965332] died en route or shortly after arrival, he remarried [Frieda Sisselman|I39965387], daughter of a prominent rabbi in Jaffa.

**Destination:** Palestine

 **2. [Haim Yehuda חיים יהודה Hochman|I11032861]** (b. circa 1870)
The second son, known as Hyam Yudl. In his youth, he witnessed terrible pogroms in Savran. He married [Sarah Bersharda|I39967468] in Balta on 15 August 1891. A member of the **Hovevei Zion** (Lovers of Zion) movement, Hyam purchased land in Doran (later Rehovot) from Yehoshua Hankin while still in Russia. He emigrated to Palestine in the early 1890s, where his first three children were born.

**Destination:** Palestine  
**→ Australia: 1 January 1901** (Fremantle)  
He was the first of the family to arrive in Western Australia, coming with Sarah and their children. Hyam worked as a fruiterer and helped establish subsequent family members in Perth.

**3. [Avraham Hochman|I39114938]** (b. circa 1872)
Little is known about Avraham. He may have perished in Russia or emigrated without leaving records.

 **4. [Josef Hochman|I38740193]** (b. circa 1875)
Josef married [Tubb'l|I10018191293] and had children. His daughter Devora (Elka Dora) arrived in Melbourne in the 1920s, reporting that the remnant of the family still in Russia had been killed during the terrible pogroms of 1919.

**5. [Kolman Hochman|I39115025]** (b. circa 1878)
Very little information is available about Kolman. He may have perished in Russia or emigrated without leaving records.

**6. [Binyamin Hochman|I39114997]** (b. circa 1880)
Binyamin may have died young. His name was later given to a nephew, [Ben Benzion Hoffman|I40778886], son of Hershl, following Ashkenazi naming tradition.

 **7. [Sholem Hochman|I39114787]** (b. 1884, d. 1921)
Sholem married Shaindl Schutte. He may have emigrated to the United States (Pittsburgh is mentioned in family records).

**Destination:** The USA

 **8. [Moshe משה Hoffman|I11052340]** (b. 15 April 1884, d. 7 April 1973)
Born in Savran, Moshe (Moishe) trained as a wheelwright. He was conscripted into the Tsarist army around 1906 and served as a military wheelwright. He witnessed horrific pogroms, including mounted Cossacks decapitating Jews with swords.

**→ Australia: 25 April 1910** (Fremantle, aboard the *Scharnhorst*)  
Moshe arrived with [Tobl|I38735986] and his 17-year-old nephew [Wolfe|I38740219]. He became a successful fruiterer, publican, and businessman in Perth, establishing the family's reputation in Western Australia.

 **9. ["Bobka" Hochman|I39114448]** (b. circa 1885, d. during pogrom)
The only daughter among ten children. "Bobka" was likely a nickname derived from the Yiddish word for "beans," also used to denote something small—perhaps "our kid sister." She met her death in the river during a pogrom in Savran.

 **10. [Yisrael Hochman|I39114550]** (b. 1889, d. 1958)
The youngest son, known as Israel or Jack. He married [Rachel Zelzer|I100527944].

**→ Australia: 1907**  
Yisrael arrived in Western Australia in 1907, joining his brother Hyam Yudl in the fruit trade and hospitality business.

### The Next Generation: Berl, Hershl and Wolfe

Though technically the next generation, **Berl** and **Hershl**—the sons of Shimon Meir—were born in **Savran** and were roughly the same age as some of their younger uncles. They experienced the same harsh conditions and persecution, and they too became founding members of the Australian family.

 **11. [Berl Hochman|I39965449]** (b. circa 1885 in Savran, d. 1950)
Born in Savran before his family fled to Palestine. Berl grew up in harsh conditions and decided to seek his fortune in Australia.

**→ Australia: 1904** (via Palestine)  
Berl became a successful fruiterer in Westonia and other goldfield towns. In 1908, his bride [Rivka Sisselman|I40775621] was sent from Palestine to marry him. They had four children, all born in Western Australia.

 **12. [Hershl Hochman|I39965497]** (b. 8 February 1888 in Savran, d. 11 December 1969)
Hershl (Harry or Hershel) was the second son of Shimon Meir, carried as an infant during the family's desperate flight from Savran. He married [Rachel Gillik|I40778657] from Chornomyn on 18 April 1908 in Jaffa. Hershl worked as a fitter and turner for an engineering company in Palestine.

**→ Australia: 28 May 1915** (aboard the Orient Line's *Orsova*)  
Facing deteriorating conditions during World War I, Hershl and Rachel came to Australia with their two young sons, Bruce (age 6) and Ben (age 3). They paid £57 for their passage from Port Said. Four more children were born in Perth.

Hershl worked at **Eilbeck's Engineering Works** in West Perth for **46 years**, eventually becoming foreman. He was a respected member of the community and helped other Jewish immigrants establish themselves.

 **13. [Wolfe Hoffman|I38740219]** (b. 1 November 1891 in Khoshchevato, Podolia)
Wolfe was the son of [Josef Hochman|I38740193]. He left Russia together with his uncle [Moshe|I11052340] when he was 17 years old.

**→ Australia: 25 April 1910** (Fremantle, aboard the *Scharnhorst*)  
Wolfe arrived with Moshe and worked as a labourer and millhand in Western Australia. He was naturalized in 1913.

**World War I Service:**  
Wolfe enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 20 March 1915 as Private 2224. He served with the 16th Battalion and arrived at **Gallipoli** in time for the Battle of Sari Bair (6-8 August 1915). He was a true **"Digger"**—the Australian term for ANZAC soldiers who served with courage and mateship during the Great War.

### Why They Left: The Dark Years

From 1881 onward, the lives of Russia's Jews were shattered by a relentless series of pogroms, restrictive laws, and state-sponsored violence.

Following the assassination of **Tsar Alexander II** in 1881, a wave of pogroms swept through southwestern Russia. In May 1882, Alexander III approved the infamous **May Laws**, temporarily forbidding Jews from settling outside towns, denying them mortgages, forbidding them from conducting business on Sundays and Christian holy days, imposing quotas on Jewish students in schools and universities, and barring Jews from many professions.

Between **1882 and 1921**, the communities of Podolia—Savran, Bershad, and others—bore the brunt of massacres carried out by Tsarist forces, armed militias, Cossacks, and later revolutionary factions.

Moshe himself witnessed mounted troops with swords **decapitating Jews** in the streets.

By 1920, more than **two million Jews** had fled the Russian Empire. The vast majority went to the United States; others went to England, South Africa, Argentina, and Australia. About **thirty thousand**—the idealists and pioneers of the **First and Second Aliyah**—went to Ottoman Palestine to rebuild the Land of Zion.
