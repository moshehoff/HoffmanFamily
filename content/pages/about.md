The information on this website is based on material that my father, Peter Hoffman, collected, researched, and compiled over many years. When uploading the information to this website, I made every effort to remain faithful to the source.

If there is an error in the information or if a piece of information is missing, please feel free to contact me at [moshe.hoffman@gmail.com](mailto:moshe.hoffman@gmail.com).

Please contact me at [moshe.hoffman@gmail.com](mailto:moshe.hoffman@gmail.com), and I will be happy to help you add your contributions to the site.

## Acknowledgments

This project would not be possible without the dedication of family members who have shared their stories, preserved precious documents, and supported the effort to document our collective history.
