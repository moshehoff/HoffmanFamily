## The Hoffman history in Australia

Our family history in Australia begins in February 1901 when [Haim Yudl](../profiles/Haim-Yehuda-חיים-יהודה-Hochman) and his family landed at the port of Fremantle. 

After an introduction, I elaborate the histories as I have interpreted them. The first chapter of these histories deal with his earliest years in Australia, and the arrivals and histories of his brothers and nephews in Western Australia. Their stories are intimately related, as a dominant theme is the assistance and partnerships of one and the other in the new country. As such, in "The First Twenty Years" all their stories intertwined. After about 1920, all were independently employed or private businessmen, and each has his own chapter.
